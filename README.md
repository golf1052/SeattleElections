# Seattle Elections
Top level for all Seattle elections stuff

## Directories

- `SeattleElectionsData` contains lots of elections data between 2017 and 2021 and all the data used to create the 2021 general election prediction post.
- `utils` contains a bunch of different utilities that are used to transform election data into other forms of election data. It also contains the code used to simulate the 2021 general election in `SimulateElection`. If you want to run it in VSCode I recommend opening the directory directly instead of opening it from this top level directory.
